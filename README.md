#Final Project
##Knitting Pattern Generator

###Patterns galore!
I'm a knitter.  I knit.  A _lot_.  And sometimes I'll use existing images, convert them to bitmaps, distort as needed to suit my ratio of stitches:rows per inch, and generate a pattern.  In the past I've done this manually, but I'd like to automate the process and store the results in a database that people can browse and use.
